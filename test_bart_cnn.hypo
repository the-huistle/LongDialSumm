The meeting was mainly about the transcription of the corpus , including the topic of audio monitoring and transcribing . The team discussed the topic of transcribing and transcribing the corpus , and the topic of transcribing the audio of meetings . The team also discussed the topic of transcribing the audio of meetings , and the topic of transcribing the audio of meetings . The team also discussed the topic of transcribing the audio of meetings , and the topic of transcribing the audio of meetings .
The team was discussing the status of microphones and channels . The two new microphones were in and were being assembled as they were being assembled . The team was also considering getting another wireless setup , which was expensive but better than the wired . The team was also considering getting more wireless mikes and more wireless receivers .
The team had some problems with wired microphones , but they seemed to have a reliable way of getting the data in , which was through the Sony radio mikes , as long as they were conscious about the batteries . The quality of the recordings was good and the quality seemed good . The team was concerned about the battery issue .
The transcriptions are currently in the process of being transcribed . The team is working on ensuring that the data are clean first , and then channelized . The team is also incorporating additional conventions that Liz requested in terms of having a systematic handling of numbers , acronyms , and acronyms .

The meeting was about the Children , Young People and Education Committee 's inquiry on education otherwise than at school . The panel of witnesses included Sharon Davies , head of learning , Torfaen County Borough Council , Nick Williams , director of education , Swansea city and county council , and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales , and David Hopkins , interim head of education at the Welsh Local Government Association . The group discussed the reasons for the increase in the number of exclusions from school . The main reasons were the prevalence of ASD and the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder , and the system 's struggle to catch up to have enough capacity to do that . The group also discussed the school accountability measures and the interim measures coming in the system .
The meeting discussed the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general . Sharon Davies said that the new Act was going to place more pressure on the system , and that the schools would need to spend more in light of the new Act . Nick Williams said that the Government did not think about the staff in the pupil referral units , and they had gone back to the Government to tell them , 'Right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training . ' David Hopkins thought that the ALN legislation would put pressures on ALN legislation , but he did not think the ALN legislation would put pressures on schools .
David Hopkins thought that the delegation levels were already very high in most authority areas , and they had got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money , or as much money as possible , was devolved to schools . He also thought that the ALN legislation would put pressures on , not just local authorities and schools , but also on the post-16 sector , because they were talking now about a wider age rangeâ€”doing up to 25 as well .
David Hopkins thought that the factors that really affected exclusions were the narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment , which had put pressure on some schools , and headteachers had felt that some pupils were sometimes excluded , or otherwise put into another school as a consequence . And on the additional learning needs side , whilst the Minister had currently made some more money available , there were financial pressures there , but he did n't think the levels of delegation had any impact on that .
Nick Williams said that the networking within the PRU sector had improved a lot and there was definitely a better sharing of practice . The team-around-the-family approach was still needed to ensure what was needed for the learner to go back into school , what could the school provide . The team-around-the-family approach was looking at the whole package of support , then , that surrounds not just the learner but the family , whether it was transport or whether it was transport .
Nick Williams said that the more challenging learners were the ones who were coming to the end of their statutory education , the key stage 4 . It was far , far more difficult when they were 15 , 16 to get them back into mainstream . Then , they were looking more at how they transit , then , into further education and colleges and so on . It came back to that team-around-the-family approach , to ensure what was needed for that learner to go back into school , what can the school provide . It was looking at the whole package of support , then , that surrounds not just the learner but the family , whether it was transport , whether it was transport , whether it was looking at the whole agenda , then , to ensure that everything was in place for that learner to go back to school , where it was possible .
Sharon Davies said that the school should ensure what is needed for the learner to go back into school , what can the school provide . It 's looking at the whole package of support , then , that surrounds not just the learner but the family , whether it 's transport , whether it 's agenda , then , to ensure that everything is in place for that learner to go back to school , where it 's possible .
Nick Williams explained that the reason for the delays was capacity , which was not enough spaces in some cases . The school had reinvigorated the managed move provision and discussion , which gave almost a second chance to learners . The school was struggling sometimes for additional provision , which was very important around safeguarding . The school was managing the pressures in its own provision , and it was managing those pressures in the provision whilst it went out and observed through a provision framework to make sure that the provision was . To actually offer some additional training was a challenge .
Janet Finch-Saunders thought that local authorities should take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition . She would n't like to think anyone was falling through the net in terms of tuition , or safeguarding even . Sharon Davies thought that the difficulty with home tuition was that as a local authority , they were restricted on how much access they could get into the home .
Nick Williams explained that the home-tuition staff work for the local authority , and they do not use agency staff , for instance , to go in and provide a few hours of provision , or to go to the local library . For whatever reason , for whatever reason , their needs at the moment ca n't be met in a school or in approved provision , then the staff who do provide some education , or if it 's for medical reasons , they work for the local authority . So , they are not using agency staff .
The meeting discussed the curriculum as it stands and the challenges associated with it . The team was satisfied with the current curriculum , but there was still work to do . The team was concerned about the balance between the PRUs and the schools , and the educational system 's ability to provide a broad and balanced curriculum . The team also discussed the recruitment of professional staff . The team was concerned about the lack of experience in the special education system and the lack of support for the special education students .
Sharon Davies thought that the capacity for professional training was limited , but it was getting better . There were networks now , there were conferences , but it was still limited . Nick Williams said that it was a capacity issue , because if they took them out of the provision , it would be difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands .
Nick Williams thought that the remote areas of Wales had provision for the EOTAS learners , and that the distances that the learners were having to travel were huge . He also thought that the remote areas were relatively compact , so it was not such an issue . However , the distances that those learners were having to travel were huge .
This meeting was the kick off meeting for the team . Project Manager introduced the team members and introduced the aims of the project . The aim was to produce a remote control that was original , trendy and user friendly . The team members then drew their favourite animals on the white board to sum up the characteristics of that animal . The team discussed the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design of the remote control . The team members then discussed the project plan and discussed the tool training and project plan .
The group discussed about animal characteristics in the next meeting . Project Manager asked the group to draw their favourite animal on the white board and then talk about it . User Interface drew a dolphin , and the group agreed that dolphins were smart , cute , cute and graceful , and graceful . User Interface also liked its tail and looked intelligent . Project Manager thought that the remote control should be trendy and user-friendly .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should have a call button to help users find it . User Interface also suggested that the remote control could have a light , a vibrating thing , a magnet on the back , and a home for it . Project Manager agreed with User Interface and suggested that the remote control could be put under the couch .
Marketing thought that the remote control should be bigger to not lose , and User Interface thought it should be bigger . Project Manager thought it should be like a hand-sized remote control . Industrial Designer thought it should be not huge , but not too big . Marketing did n't think the remote control should be too big . User Interface thought it should be like a light thing or like a spaceship .
User Interface thought that the remote control should not have too many buttons because he hated when people had too many buttons . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control could be made with a screen and could be programmed with a programming function . User Interface thought that the programming function could be like a select button to select favourite channels .
Project Manager suggested having a clip on the remote control because he thought it would be a simple thing to clip to the remote control .
The group discussed about the project plan and target revenue . Project Manager firstly , the selling price goal was twenty-five Euro and profit aim was fifty million Euro . Marketing suggested that the group should sell two two two million , two two two million , more than four million , and more than four million . Industrial Designer proposed to sell two million , Industrial Designer proposed to sell two million , and Marketing proposed to sell four million . User Interface proposed to sell two million . Marketing suggested to sell two million .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should be easy to use with ease of use , and the user interface should be easy to understand . Industrial Designer agreed that the remote control should have a learning curve , and the scroll bar could be used as a shortcut for the voice recognition . Project Manager suggested that the buttons could be made in rubber or plastic . Marketing suggested that the remote control should be yellow with yellow colouring with grey or black . User Interface agreed that the remote control should be fancy and the user interface should be easy to use .
Marketing introduced the evaluation criteria of remote control . The team agreed that the most important criteria were spongy look and feel , fancy look and feel , colour and material , and the colour and material of the remote control . Project Manager gave a two-point rating to the remote control for being fancy and spongy . User Interface gave it a two-point rating for being trendy and trendy with a lot of fashion and colouring . Industrial Designer gave it a two-point rating for being fancy and having a fancy look and feel .
Marketing thought the most important function was easy to use , the zapping , channel switching , volume , but the more advanced functions were probably a bit harder . User Interface thought voice recognition was hard to learn , and the elderly would not use it . Project Manager thought the remote control was easy to use overall .
Marketing thought the remote control was not competitive in the evaluation criteria , but the voice recognition could add a lot . Industrial Designer thought the remote control was completely programmable and advanced . User Interface thought the remote control was quite advanced and could be used to programme the remote control with voice recognition . Project Manager thought the remote control had enough features and was competitive for the market .
The group discussed the production costs of the product . Project Manager firstly raised the price of the product to twelve Euro fifty , then he came up with twelve Euro forty cents by leaving out the solar cells , by not using the voice recognition feature , and by not using the special form . The group then discussed the cost of the push buttons , which were not the most expensive , but did add extra cost . Project Manager then suggested that the team should focus on the basic remote control , which was not fancy but easy to use .
The group thought that the production costs were too high . Project Manager suggested that they could reduce the cost by leaving out the solar cells , not using the voice recognition feature , and using plastic instead of rubber . However , the group thought that the cost of the push buttons was still too high .
Industrial Designer proposed that the price of fifty Euros was quite expensive , but it was not too expensive for a remote control that had this functionality . An original remote control of any kind , a Phillips remote control , which cost more than fifty Euros , was quite expensive . There were other remote controls which control stereo , television , D-V-D , C-D player , for under twenty-five Euros . And it was easier to use because those remote controls did n't offer voice recognition and this one did .
The meeting was mainly about conceptual design of the remote control . Project Manager firstly gave a presentation on the market trends and the methods used to decide on current trends and so on . The group discussed the properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . The group decided on a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal , a shell , rechargeable batteries , a port and an alarm for getting it lost , and the company 's image in the remote control . Then Project Manager presented on the market trends and the general findings . The group decided on the most important aspect required in a remote control device and decided on the most important aspect i needed in a remote control device . The group also discussed the fashion update and the material of the remote control .
The team made some final decisions on the conceptual design of the remote control . The team decided on leaving out the voice recognition , a flip design and a different shape , a shell , rechargeable batteries , a port and an alarm for getting it lost , and the design of the remote control to be a fashion update using consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . The team also decided on the most important aspect of the remote control , fancy look and feel , which was the most important , was twice as important as the technologically innovative , which was in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
The team decided on leaving out the voice recognition , a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal . They were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal . They were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and the port and an alarm for getting it lost .
Marketing said that the most important aspect for remote controls was people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . Also , people want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as they predicted , that it should be easy to use . The first of those findings , fancy look and feel , was the most important , which was twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which was in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
The chip called the TA-A-A-double one eight three five is used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals based on the user 's input . The silicone P-C-B board is a printed circuit board with contacts that are really close together and when the user presses down on the rubber button , it connects the circuit and each each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it 's fired out of this L-E-D in the sequence of on and off bursts .
The kinetic battery was like the kinetic battery in wrist watches , which was a smaller cell which charges into the smaller cell and charges into the form of a watch battery . The energy source was solar , which was from the sun and would last for a long time . The standard triple A battery would take less space , but the dynamo would take more space because it would take a physical sort of handle to wind up . The energy source was not rechargeable , so users would not have to wind up the remote control for very long . The kinetic battery was like the kinetic battery in wrist watches , which was a smaller cell which charges into the smaller cell and charges into the form of a watch battery .
The team decided to use plastic as the main case housing because it was the most popular material this year . The team also discussed the design of the buttons , which were made out of rubber because of the spongy feel and the buttons were made out of the same material as the buttons used in stress balls . The team also discussed the design of the case cover , which could be made out of rubber and could be made into a cover or a skin .
The industrial designer suggested that the remote control could have a bare P-C-B circuit board with buttons in different colours and a touch screen , which could be arranged in an array . The user interface designer suggested that the remote control could have a flat screen inside , which could be made of rubber . The user interface designer also suggested that the remote control could have a touch screen , but the industrial designer did not want to use a curved screen because it would be too hard to use and too hard to be removed .
Marketing suggested that the team could have a small pointer thing to press the button , but Industrial Designer thought that it could get easily lost . User Interface thought that a user who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often would find it very irritating to use a touch-pad and might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like a button .
Marketing suggested that when the remote control was opened , it could be a compact mirror that could respond to the turn of the body . The team was not keen on the idea because they were marketing to guys as much as they were to women .
The remote control would be made of plastic and the material used in the chip , and the chip would be used in pretty much every remote control . The battery option was not rechargeable , so the team was looking into battery options . The team thought the standard double A and triple A were a bit too bulky at the moment , so they were looking into the standard triple A and double A , which were a bit bit too bulky at the moment . The team also considered the solar charging , which was from the sun , and kinetic charging which was like kinetic charging watches .
User Interface shared the findings of the previous meeting and the team discussed the design of the new remote . The team decided to have a combination of boards , a combination of rubber buttons on the top and a combination of buttons on the bottom . The remote would have a combination of buttons on the top and bottom , with the buttons to keep frequently changing the channels . The remote would have a G-U-I graphic user interface in the middle of the flip-top , which would be like the icons or touch pads in the computer . The remote would have speech recognition and voice recognition to check the status of the remote .
The speech recognition feature would be adopted if the team decided to use it . The cost would be cheaper if the team could start with the black and white one . The team could upgrade later .
The meeting was about the COVID-19 Pandemic . The members discussed the progress of the government 's response to the crisis . The members also discussed the future of the government 's response to the crisis . The meeting was mainly about the response of the government to the crisis . The members discussed the response of the government to the crisis , and the future of the government 's response to the crisis . The meeting also discussed the future of the government 's response to the crisis .
The members of the opposition party made several statements during the meeting . First , Paul Lefebvre thanked the people of Sudbury for their efforts in the face of COVID-19 . He also praised the contribution of the people of Sudbury , including first responders , volunteers , health care and essential workers , local miners , the farmers and produce growers who were feeding families , and local businesses who were staying connected with their staff . Then , Mike Kelloway expressed his pride in the way constituents in Cape BretonCanso had come together to look out for one another during the challenging times . In addition , Sylvie Brub expressed her concern about the lack of action taken by the government to address the problem of missing and murdered indigenous women .
The Prime Minister and Government were accused of tabled $ 87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study , debate and pass it . The allocated time was wholly inadequate . Canadians deserve to know how that money was being spent . They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament . It was Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who would have the responsibility to pay for this government 's spending . It was Canadian workers and businesses who would have to do the hard work of rebuilding the economy . A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety was not democracy . Canadians were owed better .
The members discussed the impact of the pandemic on various groups , including the aboriginal community , the students , the families of addicts , and the charities and care centres . The members also discussed the need to help the students to recover from the disease .
The Auditor General had to do more with less under the government , and her ability to conduct audits was being affected . The Auditor General had indicated that she would be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . The government could not explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars worth of supposed infrastructure investments had gone . The $ 35-billion Infrastructure Bank had completed precisely zero projects .
The Prime Minister was asked to extend the CERB for families in need . The opposition party was against this and wanted to know if the government would extend the CERB if it was clear that the government would not penalize the CERB if it extended the CERB if there were no penalties on those who were desperately in need . The opposition party was against this and wanted to know if the government would extend the CERB if it was clear that it would not penalize the CERB if it was clear that the government would not penalize the CERB if it extended the CERB .
Hon. Carla Qualtrough assured the members that the government was very aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls . As for the COVID-19 relief programs , the government had taken into consideration improvements to the EI system , the wage subsidy and the future of CERB .
The meeting was about the project project to create a new remote control . Project Manager introduced the project method and the selling price of the product would be twenty-five Euros . Project Manager said it would be an international remote control and the product costs would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . Project Manager also asked the team to make a list of favourite characteristics of the remote control and to draw favourite animals on the whiteboard . Project Manager also asked the team to work on the design of the technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
The project manager introduced the project project and the team members would have to design a new remote control with new functionalities that did not exist in the existing remote controls now . The remote control would be international and would be user-friendly . The product would be priced at 12.5 Euros and would be made of plastic and rubber .
Project Manager proposed that the product should be international because they wanted to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . As everybody everybody would have to use it , and it would be the same as keyboards .
The product price would be 25 Euros and the cost would be 12.5 Euros . The product would be easy to use and simple . The product cost would not be more than 12.5 Euros .
The group members were asked to work on the design of the remote control and the design of the technical fun functions of the remote control . The group members were also asked to design the user interface and the function design . The group members were also asked to think of the user requirement specifications .
User interface designer would design the relation between the user and the remote control . Industrial designer thought that the user interface designer would design how the user would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control . User Interface thought that industrial design would design the function design .
User Interface suggested that the user interface designer would design the user interface design and the industrial designer would design the function design . Industrial Designer agreed that the user interface designer would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control . User Interface thought that the industrial design would design the function design .
The meeting was mainly about the design of a new version of the JavaBayes program for the presentation of the model . The team discussed the features of the model and the pros and cons of each feature . The team discussed the design of the model and the features that they wanted to add to it . The team also discussed the design of the model and the features that they wanted to add to it . The meeting ended with a discussion about the design of the model and the features that the team wanted to add to it .
Grad B explained that the belief net would have two features , one for each feature , and the other for the middle layer . The features would be drawn from the communication of some abstract idea , like the person at the screen trying to communicate some abstract idea , like `` I am a tourist I want to go to this place '' . The middle layer would be the features along the lines of where the person wanted to go and what they had said previously . The features would also include the means that they should use . The hidden variables would be whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry .
The discourse model would help in the resolution of anaphora resolution and help in the gesture screen issues . The discourse model would also help in the coordination of the discourse model and the interface . The discourse model would be added into the disc into the representations every diatribe , and it would help in the discourse processing .
The team discussed the intentionality of the features they had discussed in the presentation . The features included the prosody , the discourse , the discourse , and the verb choice . The team also discussed the features of the landmark , the context , the time of day , and the time of day .
The middle layer would be made up of features that were drawn from the communication of the user , like the abstract idea of being a tourist , and the features of where the user wanted to go and what they had said previously . The middle layer would also have hidden variables , like whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry .
The discourse model stores what was presented at what location on the screen . It helps an anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . It has a very clear interface .
The team was looking for someone to be the wizard for the data collection , who would be familiar with the data and could transcribe a little bit , recruit subjects , organize them , and so forth . Fey was willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also transcribe a little bit , and recruit subjects . Jerry suggested that they should have a trial run with her to see whether she could actually do all the spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that they expect of the wizard .
The meeting was mainly about the design of the remote control . Project Manager started with the presentation of the last meeting , and the team had a discussion about the design of the remote control . The team was very satisfied with the design of the remote control , and the team was very satisfied with the product 's appearance . The team then discussed the design of the remote control and the marketing requirements of the product . The team was very satisfied with the product and the team was very satisfied with the product 's appearance . The team then discussed the design of the remote control and the marketing requirements .
The team discussed the functional requirements of the remote control , including the design of the remote control , the size , the buttons , the shape , the buttons , the buttons of the remote control , and the buttons of the remote control . The team agreed that the remote control should be a universal remote control , but it should be only for TV . The remote control should be made for kids and elderly people . The team also agreed that the remote control should be bigger and bigger , and the remote control should be made for the elderly .
Marketing suggested giving up on speech recognition because younger people were more interested in new features , while older people were more critical and wanted to spend more money . Marketing also suggested that speech recognition was not reachable for twenty-five Euros because it was too expensive .
Marketing suggested that the remote control should be simple and easy to use for the elderly because the elderly people need it . User Interface agreed with Marketing 's suggestion , but User Interface also thought that the product should stand out by the looks of it , and not just a different colour or different shape .
User Interface introduced the technical function design of the remote control . The team wanted to keep it simple and standardised , so that only ten percent of the buttons were being used . The basic functions would be volume , channels , the basic according to the user 's preference , text service options , basic on-off , and basic on-off . User Interface also suggested that the remote control could be made to work with favourite buttons .
The meeting was about the design of the remote control . Project Manager started with the group 's individual presentations on the progress made by the team . Marketing and User Interface gave presentations on the market situation and the design of the remote control . Project Manager then asked the team to make a decision on the design of the remote control . The group decided to use the same design as the last meeting , but with some changes . The group also discussed the design of the remote control with the team members .
Project Manager introduced the agenda of the meeting , including the discussion on the remote control concept , the individual presentations , the decision on the design of the remote control , and the closing . The group discussed the market situation and the design of the remote control . The group agreed that the remote control should be made with a fancy look and feel , but innovation was more important than the design . The group also discussed the design of the remote control with the target group and the price of the remote control .
Marketing suggested that the young target group liked fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they wanted spongy material . The older group still preferred dark colours and simple shapes . The feel of the material had to be spongy . The younger group liked more colourful objects . The corporate colours were grey and yellow . The group agreed to use soft materials and make it colourful or make it colourful or like cell phones , exchangeable covers .
The team decided to use a spongy material as the remote control style . The feel of the material had to be spongy and the material should not be too hard . The team also decided to use soft materials and make it colourful or colourful like cell phones , exchangeable covers .
The team had three different casing possibilities . The uncurved or flat case was the most common remote control form , which was just a box . The curved one was curved in two dimensions , which was a bit like a wave form . The double-curved one was curved in three dimensions , which was a little more advanced in its shape . The team decided to choose the single-curved one because it was the best of two worlds .
The group discussed the user interface controls of the remote control . The group agreed that the push-buttons and scroll-wheels could be integrated with buttons . The group also discussed the possibility of integrating a scroll-bar on the side . The group also discussed the possibility of making a mute button .
The team thought that the scroll-wheels could be integrated with buttons , but User Interface did not think that there was any possibility for this . Project Manager thought that the scroll-wheels could be used to select channels . User Interface thought that the scroll-wheels could be used to select channels .
The team decided not to use LCD displays because they were not very sure about the cost . Besides , the LCD display was not flashy and new . It was also not standard enough . Besides , the team did not have enough space in the finance to integrate LCD displays .
The meeting started with a presentation from Industrial Designer about the working design of the remote control . Project Manager then went over the last meeting and the team decided on the design of the remote control . The remote control would be a universal one with one handset for all , one for TV , video equipment , and a flip-open design with an electronic panel for further features like programming . The team also discussed the size of the remote control and whether to reduce the size of the control and an electronic panel . Then , Marketing presented on the budget and the design of the remote control . The team decided to use a flip-open design and reduce the size of the control and an electronic panel . User Interface then presented on the cost issue and suggested that the remote control could be wireless and the remote control could be made small .
The group discussed the size issue of the remote control and the battery . The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control could be made smaller and the remote control could be made with a circular shape . The group also discussed the power source and the size of the battery . The group also discussed the design of the remote control and the interface .
Industrial Designer thought that most remote controls used infrared to send signals to the TV because of the cost issue and the fact that it was wireless and did not need to send much information . He also thought that triple A batteries were the smallest and easiest to carry around .
Marketing presented the results of the market research , which showed that users found most remote controls ugly and would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Users also found that remote controls were often lost in the room , and the biggest frustrations were often lost in the room , which was a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing . Users also found that remote controls took too much time to learn to use and that they took too much time to learn about the other functions . Users also found that remote controls were bad for repetitive strain injury and small movements of the remote control could lead to shoulder and elbow problems . The vast majority of the thirty-five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , which was to aid in the case of lost remote controls . Project Manager also suggested that the remote control should only be for TV , and the team would not use teletext because consumers considered it outdated with the internet now .
Marketing suggested that the alarm could help users find the remote control when it slipped down the back of the sofa and help reduce the cost . Industrial Designer agreed with Marketing and suggested that the alarm could be incorporated on the remote control to help people find it .
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control would be physically different because people in Japan had smaller hands and could n't get round the controller which was too big . Therefore , the remote control could have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others . User Interface suggested that a touch screen could be a better option for the safety of repeated use .
The remote control would be made in a shape like a chocolate box , curled up like a banana , slightly curved , curved , and semi-circular in the bottom . The remote control would be made moulded according to the user 's hand shape . The remote control would be made in a vague C-shaped shape that opened up like a shell , or something . The remote control would be made in plastic , and the company logo could be incorporated into the design .
The meeting was about the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification . The group discussed the issue of the qualification and the qualification of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification . The group members thought that the qualification was providing the skills that the employers needed to develop the actual professional skills within the industries . The group also discussed the issue of the qualification and the qualification of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification .
Dafydd Evans thought that employers did not have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac meant or what it included . He thought that the title of the Welsh bac was not helpful , because it did not say what was happening in the tin . He thought the skills challenge certificate was a better title , and was something that people understood a lot better than the Welsh bac . Dr Rachel Bowen thought that the understanding of the baccalaureate varied by size of employer as well . Kay Martin thought that the understanding was quite limited for the employers they worked with .
Ed Evans thought that it was fair to say employers did n't understand it , but he thought if they did , they would really appreciate this . For his sector in particular , the civil engineering sector and particularly the contracting sector , which depends very much on pupils who had come through from a less academic background , the Welsh baccalaureate gave them that ability , not to pursue so much of an academic focus , but to test them in terms of the challenges , but also , to learn directly from industry .
Dafydd Evans thought that the voice of employers should be a key part of the review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills should have more of a role within the qualification . Ed Evans agreed that they needed more employers involved in this . There were opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than they did at the moment . They were involved in lots of social value-type contracts in the sector , which was a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way .
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities . One of the problems was that a number of children coming in to the colleges needed to resit their GCSEs , which ate into the time and the capacity of the learners . The Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications , which was not just one qualification but a combination . To develop the employability skills obviously was a key part , and developing the skills for employment was a key part .
The Welsh bac did help prepare learners for employment , but it was not for everyone . Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels , even in a vocational programme , was too big for them . They were coming from schools with very few GCSEs , or they had n't got literacy and numeracy skills , or they were being tested and many of them were below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy . So , it needed to be reviewed to look at how they could make skilled and employable people . It helps prepare some peopleâ€”the A-level students for universityâ€”but did it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable ? No , it did not .
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities . One of the problems was that a number of children coming in to the colleges needed to resit their GCSEs , which ate into the time that they had to teach young people . There was no room for everything in the curriculum somehow . There was no room in the funding or in terms of the capacity of the learner to do that number of qualifications . The Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications , it was not just one qualification . To develop the employability skills obviously was a key part , and developing the skills for employment was a key part .
Kay Martin thought that universities in the main did not understand the value of the Welsh baccalaureate , especially the experience they had with some of their learners to go to Russell Group universities . In some areas , and certainly the local universities around here , the local universities around here value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students go to Cardiff Met , and business studies , when our learners go to USW . It is valued by them and they accept it , but when people go further afield , and they 're always trying to push their learners beyond . Where they can afford to go away to university , they encourage that . But some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate .
Nick Brazil thought that the Welsh bac had evolved into quite a rigorous , complicated , qualification , which put added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they were trying to get possibly three A* grades . So , he thought they needed to consider that . In relation to the first answer , it was variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities would make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it was a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the Russell Group report indicated about facilitating subjects , and Welsh bac at the moment was not a facilitating subject .
Dafydd Evans explained that because of the nature of the catchment area , there was a greater percentage of students staying in Welsh universities , and Welsh universities were much more willing to recognise the bac . However , there were differences between the policy that the university extols and what actually happened on the ground when students had interviews in those universities . In terms of Bangor and GlyndÅµr University , there was no problem there .
Dafydd Evans thought that it was not assured in terms of the training required regarding the Welsh bac , but where they were seeing it more successfully was where vocational lecturers had actually taken it on board . Therefore , if it was going to be a success , it had to be contextualised , and they had invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac . It had been an intensive staff development process . Nick Brazil thought that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well . So , a number of those staff had already got those skills and they were undertaking that . Ed Evans thought that bringing in some experts , bring in some business , raise the profile , and it would start to get parents thinking , 'Actually , there was something more to this than just the academic bit . '

A number of those staff had already got those skills and they were undertaking that . Nick Brazil was sure that the qualification would raise the focus on the qualification , but ultimately , it would take away from the fact that they had got staff who had got those skills and they were developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they were doing .
The group discussed the conceptual design of the remote control . Project Manager reviewed the last meeting and discussed the design of the remote control . The team discussed the components design , including the buttons , the circuit board , the infrared L-E-D , the radio sender and receiver , the beeper , the beeper or buzzer , the remote control 's location and the material . The team decided to use a fruit and vegetable theme and the fancy look and feel . The team also discussed the design of the remote control . The team decided to use the iPod-like button system and the remote control with a fancy look and feel .
Marketing suggested that the first thing to aim for is a fancy look and feel , followed by the technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . The group agreed that the fashion electronics should go for the fruit and vegetable theme and also go for a spongy feel . The group also discussed whether to print the fruit stuff or to make the remote control look like a fruit . The group also discussed the material options and whether to use rubber or plastic .
The Industrial Designer firstly mentioned that the remote control would need custom design parts , and other parts would just use standard . The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control would be custom designed with a hard plastic case to protect the remote and the locator , and a circuit board would be custom designed . The circuit board would be made out of custom design parts , and the standard parts would include the buttons and the wheels , the iPod-style wheel , the infrared L-E-D , the radio sender and receiver , the beeper or buzzer , and a beeper or buzzer for locating the remote . The material options could be rubber , plastic , wood or titanium , but the Industrial Designer recommended against titanium because it could only be used in the flat cases and it was really heavy .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should have a screen with music because people would need to look for a specific song when looking for a specific song . User Interface also suggested that the remote control should be a touch-based graphical interface system . Project Manager agreed to this idea , but User Interface thought that the remote control should be a wheel because people would have to switch to TV channels .
The team discussed the options of energy . They had an option of batteries , solar power , and a dynamo . The team also discussed the possibility of wind-up , solar power , and a kinetic thing . The team decided to use batteries , and they also discussed the possibility of Kryptonite .
The Industrial Designer thought that the team could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . However , he did n't like the idea of wind-up because it seemed a little weird for the living room and solar power was not available with the rubber case anyway .
The cost of the Kryptonite was not too much because most of the stuff was pretty cheap though bought in bulk . The chip was probably the most expensive part .
The meeting started with User Interface 's presentation of the prototype of remote control . User Interface firstly asked about the speech recognition and the design of the inside . User Interface suggested that the remote control could be made to slide open and could be stronger . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the advanced chip could be used for speech recognition . User Interface then presented the prototype of remote control with the basic functions , including mute , on-off , text functions , switch channel , scroll wheel , and scroll button . User Interface also suggested that the remote control could be made to be colour changeable and transparent .
Marketing made evaluation criteria based on the market research and the Italian market research . The group agreed to give a one to seven for the evaluation . The team agreed to give the product a one or a seven for the evaluation . The team also agreed to give the product a two-point rating for the fancy look-and-feel and the colour .
Marketing thought the remote control was easy to use , but the second layer was not easy to use . User Interface thought it was easy to use , but learnable was a bit harder to learn . Marketing thought the scroll wheel was handy , but the first time the user got the remote control , it was not to use the scroll wheel . User Interface thought the scroll wheel was easy to use if the user had ever used a different kind of device . Marketing thought learnable was a less than easy to use , but definitely better than avera average .
Marketing recommended to make a power indicator , a button to call it , and a speaker to make it beep . The production cost of the battery was twelve point three Euros , and the speaker was very small and single curved curved .
The team members agreed that the project was not finished and that the biggest problem was the price issue . The team got the price right and the team had to make sure that the cost was reasonable . The drawing board was okay , but the digital pen was horrible and did not work well . The team also agreed that the drawing board was hard to make and that it was too slow to work . The team also discussed the budget and the new ideas .
User Interface said that the biggest problem was the wrong information about the price of the project . User Interface thought that the team got the wrong information at the wrong time . User Interface thought that the team should have known the price of the project before , so that they could have had a quicker discussion about the project finance .
The meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control , including conceptual design , conceptual design , conceptual design , how it 's going to go , how it 's going to go , and detailed design . User Interface drew a favourite animal on the white board and explained the characteristics of that animal . User Interface thought that the remote control should be a kind of dog , which was very supportive , loyal , and loyal to its owner . User Interface also mentioned that the remote control should be user-friendly , and that even pooches should be able to use it . Project Manager then asked the team to do tool training and discuss the project plan .
Marketing thought that the remote control should be user-friendly to everyone , especially for the international market . Project Manager agreed and said that the remote control should be accessible and usable by all age groups . User Interface suggested that the remote control should be simple and easy to use , and the group agreed on this point . Marketing also suggested that the remote control should have a simple design and not too many buttons .
Marketing thought that a menu display would be useful because it would make the remote control easier to use and would make it easier to navigate . User Interface thought that it would be easier to browse and navigate if it was similar to the menu display on mobile phones .
Industrial Designer thought that the older generation could n't even dream of texting or texting . He also thought that the age gap would be a problem regardless of the design modifications .
Marketing thought that there was no reason to make the remote control look fashionable and stylish , and that it could still be lightweight plastic . Industrial Designer agreed with Marketing , but Industrial Designer thought that the remote control could still be made of plastic .
The group discussed the price issue and target groups of remote control . Project Manager firstly mentioned the price issue . The selling price of the remote control was 25 Euros , which was expensive . The profit aim was 50 million Euros , which was in the first year . The production cost was twelve fifty Euros , and half of the selling price was taken up by building the remote control .
Marketing thought that the market range international was not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it was everyone . Project Manager agreed that the market range was going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
The meeting started with three presentations on conceptual design . User Interface Designer presented the three concepts of the user interface . The first one was a Google controller , the second was a fancy controller , and the last one was an intelligent controller . User Interface suggested that the user interface should be attractive and easy to recognise . User Interface also suggested that the remote control should use speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology . Project Manager agreed with User Interface and Industrial Designer . Marketing suggested that the remote control should be able to use voice recognition and gesture recognition .
User Interface presented three concepts of the user interface design . The first one was a Google controller , the second was a fancy controller , and the last one was an intelligent controller . The user interface wanted the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . The second concept was a fancy controller , and the third was attractive . The user interface also suggested that the intelligent controller should be smart and could use speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology .
User Interface proposed the concept of intelligent controller because he thought it was convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . User Interface also suggested that the user need to replace the controller with a controller with similar function if it did not have some function inside it . User Interface also suggested that the feature of voice recognition was not one hundred percent reliable , but it was a feature to distinguish the product from other products .
Project Manager thought that the intelligent controller could not be used all the time because people would get injured if they used the same gesture all the time . User Interface thought that it would be convenient to use voice and gesture interface than use button . For limited vocabulary speech recognition was very reliable and for limited vocabulary gesture recognition was also very reliable .
The team discussed the material of the remote control , the buttons , the battery , the type of alimentation , and the price of the product . The remote control would be made of wooden with a special high class material like wood , and the buttons would be either push buttons or LCD lights . The team also discussed the price of the product . The team decided to have a twelve Euros price and to have a low level of integrated circuits .
The group decided to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design . The group thought that it would be good to have both of them for the alimentation , so that in some country where people were in the countryside and far from the cities , they could put the remote control on the sun for one hour and after one hour , it would come back . It would be interesting for people to have this kind of remote control and it could attract the ecological consumers .
The industrial designer first proposed to use a combination of the two materials , wooden and plastic . The wooden material was considered to be resistant and special high class . The plastic material was more common and could be more common . The buttons could be either classic push buttons or the buttons that were unlighted during the night .
Marketing firstly , the user really wanted a fancy look and feel , and the functional look and feel , but the user also wanted it to be technologically innovative and easy to use . The user also wanted it to be technologically innovative , so it could be related to the speech recognition and so on . The user also wanted it to be spongy and to be connected to energy , solar energy , so the team could have wood for the bottom and some rubber for the buttons .
Marketing recommended to take the fashion trend into account when designing the remote control . The fancy look and feel was the most important one , followed by the spongy touch and the material . The marketing suggested to use plastic-like plastic and rubber for the buttons , and to have wood for the base and to have the spongy touch in the remote control .
Marketing mentioned that the main point was that people wanted a spongy touch , which did n't fit with the wooden design . Marketing suggested that the material needed to be spongy could be plastic-like , but rubber , may be rubber-like . Industrial Designer suggested that the material could be plastic but not the part touching the buttons . Marketing suggested that the material could be both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons .
This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control . The group discussed user needs , technical effects , and the working design of the remote control . The group discussed the buttons , the buttons that the team should focus on in order of importance , and the buttons that the team should design according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button . The team also discussed the technical design of the remote control . The team discussed the remote control 's appearance and the technical design . The team discussed the remote control 's appearance and the technical design . The team discussed the technical design of the remote control and the working design .
The group discussed the functional design of the remote control in the functional design meeting . The group discussed the user needs , technical effects , and the working design of the remote control . The group agreed to design the remote control according to the frequency of use and relevance of each buttons . The most important buttons were those to do channel selection , teletext , volume and power settings , and the other ones were the order selection , teletext , volume and power settings , the power , volume and power settings , the screen and speech recognition . The group also discussed the design of the remote control .
The group discussed the finder button and call button . The finder button would be a locator , which would send out a signal and would beep if the remote was in line of sight . The call button would be a radio signal like on a cell phone , and would be on the remote or on the TV or a wall or some place with power . The group decided that the buzzer would be on the remote , and the remote would be able to hear the signal and beep if it was in the line of sight . The group also discussed whether to leave the light or to add a light or to make it fashionable .
Marketing suggested that speech recognition could be programmed in every remote control . User Interface agreed with Marketing and User Interface that speech recognition could be programmed in every remote control . However , Project Manager thought that speech recognition could be expensive and the screen could be the same as the screen .
User Interface suggested that the team could design a single menu button for the remote control , which could be used to scroll through the options on the TV . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control could be of DVD type , which was the technology of the day .
The meeting was about Robert 's thesis proposal , which was about the development of a new method of recording the digits . The group discussed the proposal and discussed the process of recording the digits . The group discussed the process of recording the digits and the process of recording the digits . The group also discussed the process of recording the digits and the process of recording the digits . The group discussed the process of recording the digits and the process of recording the digits . The group also discussed the process of recording the digits and the process of recording the digits . The group discussed the process of recording the digits and the process of recording the digits . The group also discussed the process of recording the digits and the process of recording the digits .
The thesis is about the construction of a probabilistic relational model that could potentially build a general , domain-general rules how things are construed . The idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what .
The team was discussing the problems with rephrasing , and how they solved them . They were also discussing the problem of the system breaking . They were also discussing the embodied and simulation approach favored here . They were also discussing the future activities of the team .
The group discussed the problems with the rephrasing , and how they solved it . They also discussed the Bayes-net , and the future activities of the team . The team was planning to start looking at people 's brains in a more direct way .
User Interface and Industrial Designer presented the conceptual model of the remote control . User Interface suggested that the remote control should be simple and basic with few buttons , with light switches on if users use a button , and it should be easy to learn . Marketing suggested that the remote control should be fancy and innovative with new technical features . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control should be easy to use and the speech recognition should be included .
User Interface first presented the market trend on the conceptual model of the remote control . The remote control should be simple and basic with basic functions such as volume , channel , channel , channel to choose channels , an on-off , mute button , and a text T-V button . It should be easy to learn and have few buttons . The remote control should be technological innovative with new technical features . The remote control should be fancy and have an original look-and-feel .
Marketing thought that fancy look was the most important thing for remote control , so he thought about changeable fronts . Marketing suggested making a see-through one in a fruit front because it was hot , and some basic colour fronts . Marketing also suggested making five different fronts to start with , and maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .
User Interface recommended to use speech as a technology innovation because the technology department had done research about it and recommended using it . User Interface would check what the technology department 's recommendations meant .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should have a circuit board , transistors and resonators , and transistors and resonators . Industrial Designer suggested that the circuit board should be the same as the normal circuit board , like a chip board in a lot of things . User Interface agreed and suggested that the remote control should have a recharger . User Interface also suggested that the remote control should have three D 's curved with rubber buttons . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control should have two D 's curved and three D 's curved . User Interface also suggested that the remote control should have scroll wheels for volume and scroll wheels for channels .
User Interface suggested that the remote should be bigger and smaller , with speech recognition and changeable fonts . The remote should be made of plastic and the home base should be on the bottom . The remote should be made of plastic and the buttons should be simple and basic .
Marketing believed that the remote features had to be original and technological innovative . User Interface suggested that the speech recognition feature could be integrated into the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit .
The meeting was the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic . The meeting was mainly about the financial situation of the pandemic . The members discussed the financial situation of the pandemic , the response of the government to the crisis , and the response of the provinces to the crisis . The meeting also discussed the response of the government to the crisis , and the response of the provinces to the crisis .
The Prime Minister explained that the government had been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they needed it , and that had meant that there would be things they would need to clean up after the fact and work to fix , but getting that help into Canadians ' pockets during this pandemic was the priority . The Prime Minister also explained that the government had been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to Canadians .
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie said that the Prime Minister had not taken action to help workers who could lose their jobs or who had lost their jobs . He was disappointed that the government had not taken action to help the workers . He also asked about the financial situation of the credit card companies , which had to pay appallingly high user fees , which were almost 10 times higher than in Europe and Australia .
Hon . Bill Blair supported banning the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle because it was a standard farm gun used by many farmers in his riding , in fact , passed down from generation to generation in some cases . The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles , except for law enforcement and military purposes . The Ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles . In his view , these weapons had no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada 's law enforcement and and and and the military .
The Prime Minister explained that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit . However , when one moves quickly and efficiently , there would be gaps , and that 's why the government had been working diligently to try to fill those gaps . There was still more to do , but as the Prime Minister had demonstrated with the national housing strategy , they were serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians , and they would continue to do that .
Ms. Jenny Kwan said that the government had decided to implement a complicated program that left many people behind . A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19 . She paid taxes on her spousal income , but she was not eligible for CERB . The Minister of Employment said that she was looking into this gap . It had been weeks , and still no action . The Prime Minister had to correct the honourable member by pointing out that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit . However , when one moves quickly and efficiently , there would be gaps , and that 's why they had been working diligently to try to fill those gaps .
Hon . Deb Schulte said that the government had responded to the increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic with additional action . The government announced a one-time , tax-free payment of $ 300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $ 200 for seniors eligible for GIS . This meant there would be up to $ 500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time . Beyond this , the government announced $ 20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniorsfor example , to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected .
The government was expected to provide support for energy resources and tourism , and to invest in green economy and small businesses . The government was expected to provide $ 500 million to build a $ 8.5 million Coastal GasLink pipeline to produce energy for the energy crisis . The government was also expected to provide $ 500 million to build a $ 500 million Coastal GasLink pipeline to produce energy for the energy crisis .
The government was continuing to work towards the end , and it was always very important to protect Canadians , and they were going to stick to that approach . The government would continue to work with Canadian processors as the agreement came into force .
The government had moved forward with a number of measures that were designed to be of assistance . With respect to rent support , the government was encouraging landlords to support this measure . At every opportunity , the government would continue to support small businesses . The program had significant merit . It allowed for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75 % of the rent .
The minister explained that the fish and seafood sector had been extremely adversely affected because of the Covid-19 . The government had started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $ 62.5 million for processors , as well as to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers as well as people who had run out of their fishery EI . The fishery enterprises were uniquely structured , which was why the government was looking at measures to address the concerns they had . The minister also explained that the government was working with the provincial colleagues , as well as the caucus colleagues to find solutions .
The government was aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needed , from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home . The government was working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs . The government was aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needed , from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home . The government was working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and were procuring millions of items : face shields , gowns , hand sanitizer , and N95 surgical masks , and ventilators every single day .
The oil and gas industry was under severe strain . Over the past number of years , there had been tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . The federal Liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , Bill C-69 , which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada . The oil shipping ban , Bill C-48 , for the northern coast of British Columbia , also had a negative effect on the oil industry . These two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of Canada , causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels . To compound Alberta 's economic problems , the international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there were still no applications open for these loans .
The meeting was about the Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment Bill , which would remove the defense of reasonable chastity from the Children Act 2004 . The meeting was mainly about the Bill 's impact on the Children , Young People and Education Committee . The meeting was mainly about the Bill 's impact on the Children , Young People and Education Committee . The meeting discussed the Bill 's impact on the Children Act 2004 , and the Bill 's impact on the Children Act 2004 . The meeting also discussed the Bill 's impact on the Children Act 2004 , which would make it a defense for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child .
Sian Gwenllian AM asked about the efficacy of the law . Barry Hughes answered that the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature . He explained that the law should provide a much clearer legal framework to take out the reasonable punishment defense , which would make things much clearer for parents and professionals . He also explained that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity , in that it removed the defense of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm , causing grievous bodily harm , causing grievous bodily harm with intent , and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act .
Barry Hughes thought that the law as it currently stands currently protected children , and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment . There were a range of offences created by the criminal law , going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last , which provided for offences of assault against a variety of people , including Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , which provided for offences that were specific to children . In respect of children in particular , section 58 of the Children Act 2004 did make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child . That was a defence that was available for assault upon a child . By way of contrast , it was not available for an offence involving an adult . In that regard , it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults .
The first stage was whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , and the second stage was whether the first stage was satisfied . If there was n't enough evidence , the second stage was not considered . The public interest stage was only considered once the evidential stage was satisfied .
Barry Hughes explained that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England , because the defence would still apply there . This would raise issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales . The CPS had a specific provision that took account of the potential divergence of Welsh law . In the code , they would issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise . And they thought that they were sufficiently flexible to take account of that .
Barry Hughes thought that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England , because the defence would still apply there . This would raise issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales , because it was fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that was not available in Wales . The second example was that there already had within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws , and the example was drink driving . In England and Wales , the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in the breath was 35 Âµg in 100ml of breath , across the border in Scotland , it drops to 22 Âµg . As for the CPS , it had a specific provision that took account of the potential divergence of Welsh law . In this case , it would issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise . And it was sufficiently flexible to
Barry Hughes thought that draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test would not necessarily be helpful . He thought that the present public interest factors were set out very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors , and they would provide a degree of detail around those that related more specifically to the issues that they were discussing here . So , it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity . And they would need to work that up as they went along , and he thought you 'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse , if he may put it like that .
Barry Hughes explained that the police had been working with the National Police Chiefs ' Council , which was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals . There was quite a range , and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved . There was a document called the director 's guidance on charging , which was issued by the director of public prosecutions , which set out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge . Offences that the police referred to us for a charging decision would generally be offences where they felt that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal . There may be cases where it was genuinely very difficult to assess what 's the best approach , in which case they would have a conversation with them , a meaningful conversation , about what 's the best way to approach that particular case .
Barry Hughes explained that the National Police Chiefs ' Council had been working with the National Police Chiefs ' Council . Their lead was deputy chief constable Sara Glen , who was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals . There was quite a range , and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved . The police were not responsible for administering the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal , if it had conditions attached , such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate .
Barry Hughes thought that the infrastructure of out-of-court disposals could be built within Wales , which could provide for a range of out-of-court disposals . It was more likely that people would be pointed in that direction if a good infrastructure was built .
Barry Hughes thought that it was extremely unlikely that the CPS would have targets for securing convictions or not . He thought that the numbers were likely to be very limited . The CPS had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage , which threw up something like three cases in a year . There was a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secured what was called a sanction detection , which counted for Home Office figures . The CPS had a suite of measures against this , but they did n't have a suite of measures against this . The police were much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago , in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some target .
Barry Hughes thought that it was extremely unlikely . In the CPS , they did n't have targets for securing convictions or not . Clearly , they prosecute if they thought that there was a reasonable prospect , a realistic prospect , of conviction and it 's in the public interest , but they had no targets . And he would also say , because the numbers here were likely to be so small , any assertion of looking to meet targets would be a tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean .
Barry Hughes thought that it was a potential barrier , but he did not think it was a barrier . There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales , and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that . Karen Cornish thought that given the very low numbers , they would be able to manage it . She had got no significant concerns , she had to say .
The meeting discussed the collection of data for the project , including the data collection of digit recordings .

The team discussed the data collection process and the process of collecting more data . The team discussed the data collection process and the process of collecting more data .
The advantage of using Noisy-ORs was that it would be acoustic with the background . The noise would not be too loud , but it would still be audible . The noise would be hard to detect . The noise would be caused by the hard effect of spectral distortion in the speech .
The team wanted to incorporate the EVA into the Bayes-net , but they did not want to include impulsive noises . The team thought that the noise should be included in the background acoustic . The team also wanted to include a pitch extractor on the Bayes-net , but they did not have one yet .
The team discussed the data collection process and the nature of the data collection . The team was concerned about the time it would take to collect data . The team was concerned that the data collection would cut into people 's time . The team thought that they should collect a fair amount of data that was collected for the same meeting .
The team was concerned about the interaction between the data participants and their data . The team thought that they should have enough data to work with . They would like to get more regular meetings of types that they know about , and hear , then sort of a mish-mosh of a bunch of one-time one-time meetings .
The meeting was mainly about the training of neural networks on task data . The team was mainly focusing on four features , mainly four kind of features . The team was working on the English and Italian data , and also on the broad English and Spanish databases . The team was also working on the task data , and had trained several neural networks on the TI-digits English and the Italian data . The team was also working on the task data , and had trained several neural networks on the TI-digits English and the Italian data . The team was also working on the task data , and had trained several neural networks on task data .
The professor explained that the effect of training on different languages was not as bad as it seemed . The team had to be careful about the effect of training on different languages because of the compounded results . The professor also explained that the team had to be careful about the effect of training on a single language and testing on the other languages .
PhD D explained that the multilingual net was trained on features without the derivatives without the s derivatives , but with increased frame numbers . The model was slightly worse when it did not use delta .
The Professor thought that the use of English was not as bad as it seemed because the neural nets did not have so much representation of English . He thought that the problem might simply be that the nets had something more diverse , but they had the same number of parameters representing it . He thought that the team had to be careful about the compounded results .
The team discussed the complexity of the model and the various approaches to managing it . The model currently has twenty-seven broad classes , including back vowels , front vowels , and front vowels . The team discussed how to make the model more robust and how to reduce the number of out outputs . The team discussed the possibility of adding noise to the model to help it perform better .
The team discussed the IBM computers , which were only two so far . The team was not very satisfied with the IBM computers . The team was looking into how much more computational power they could have . The team was also concerned about the cost of the new IBM computers .
The team thought that the delay would be two hundred milliseconds . The delay would be within the boundaries of the boundaries of the LDA . The temporal LDA did in fact include the same delay as the temporal LDA .
The meeting was mainly about the progress of the transcriber project . The team was working on transcribing the voice data and the transcriptions of the voice data . The team was working on the transcriber interface and the transcriptions of the voice data . The team was also working on the transcriber interface and the transcriptions of the voice data . The team was also working on the transcriptions of the voice data . The team was also working on the transcriptions of the voice data .
The team decided to do something with the transcriber interface , but also decided to do something with the transcriber interface . The DARPA meeting was in mid July .
The team was working on a mock-up of a question answering system , which would be separate from the transcriber interface . The team was going to do a mock-up of the interface , but they were also going to do a mock-up of a question answering system . The team was going to do this in a pre- stored fashion .
The transcriptions are doing well , with faster and more efficient pipeline generation and fewer transcribers . The team is looking into the possibility of using speech- nonspeech labels to help with segmentation . The team is also looking into the possibility of using the transcriptions to train new transcribers .
The segmenter is now doing the recognition on automatic segmentations . The team would like to move to this method because they were essentially cheating by using hand segmentations as the basis of the recognition .
The segmenter is performing well and the team is considering moving to automatic segmentation . The team is concerned that they were cheating by using hand segmentations as the basis of recognition .
The segmenter is now discrete . The model is not working well enough to segment the environment . The model is not working well enough to segment the environment .
This meeting was about the development of a new product , a remote control , a television remote control . Project Manager introduced the project kick-off , the first meeting to generate some ideas about it . Project Manager also introduced the project plan , including the three different design stages , the conceptual development , the functional design , the detailed design , and the technical design . The team would have to use a pred a method to use a pred a method during this meeting , which would involve three different design stages . Project Manager also explained the progress of the project .
Industrial Designer presented the technical issues and proposed some ideas about remote control functions . Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment , such as cell phones , video and audio equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments . User Interface proposed some ideas about how the remote should function for the user , including the interoperability , the way of communicating with these equipments , and the way of making the remote trendy . Project Manager agreed with Industrial Designer and User Interface that the remote should work on different devices . Marketing suggested that the remote should be made to fit every device , and the marketing team agreed .
User Interface thought that the remote control should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . It should work on different devices . The remote control should be able to change the state of the TV by pressing the buttons .
Industrial Designer thought that remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment , like cell phones , video and audio equipment , and one remote control for all the equipment . There should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
Industrial Designer thought infrared was old-fashioned , but it was cost-effective and could come in handy . User Interface thought infrared and Bluetooth could be used together in one remote . Project Manager thought the remote control should be rechargeable and should not consume too much power .
Industrial Designer suggested that infrared was not really hot technical stuff anymore , so the remote control should be equipped with Bluetooth instead . The infrared was old-fashioned , but it was cost-effective and could be used to connect the remote control with TV .
User Interface thought Bluetooth might be problem because it used a lot of power . Project Manager thought that Bluetooth might be problem because cell phones had integrated Bluetooth also and it seemed to work quite okay . But User Interface disagreed because Bluetooth could not be used all the time .
The meeting was mainly about the decision on the product , on the target group , on the target group , and the functions of the remote control . The team decided that the remote control should only be used for television , and the product should be aimed at the younger generation . The team also decided that the product should be recognisable and interesting and people should be able to recognize the product 's colour and slogan . The team also decided that the product should have a corporate image and the slogan should be in the colour and the slogan should be in the product .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should be easy to use with less buttons and the user-friendliness . User Interface also suggested that the remote control should be multi-function with eight buttons . Project Manager agreed to implement multi-function in the design , but teletext buttons were not included in the design . User Interface also suggested that the remote control should be user-friendly and advanced .
Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits were not necessary for the remote control because the older people would only use five of them . However , if the younger people wanted to watch more channels , they would probably watch more channels than the older people . He thought that the ten digits were dull and looked a bit dull .
User Interface thought that the remote control should be easy to use and user-friendly . The remote control should be a combination of different functions , but it should be a combination of both the multi-function and the easy-of-use remote control . The remote control should take out eight buttons or so . User Interface also thought that the easy-of-use remote control with less possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons was the best option for the remote control .
The group discussed the technical issues about the remote control . The first thing the group discussed was the design requirements of the remote control . The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be able to send pulses of infrared light to the TV set . The User Interface suggested that the remote control should be made of rechargeable and energy-saving materials . The group also discussed the cost-effectiveness of the remote control . The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be made of energy-saving materials like LEDs and rechargeable batteries .
Marketing suggested that the buttons to zap were used about fifteen hundred times , while the power button was only used one time . The volume button was only used four times . The team agreed to build in a feature to support the audio signal , like home phones . The team also agreed to focus on the design of the remote control .
The team thought that the energy source could be incorporated into the hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . The team also thought that a cradle in which the device could recharge would be very cheap .
The meeting started with a presentation on the prototype of the remote control . User Interface and Industrial Designer presented on the prototype of the remote control . The prototype had a rubber case material , a bright funky design inspired by fruit , bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel , and the rubber buttons would be anti-R-S-I . The remote control would have a LCD screen with a black and white touch screen and a rechargeable battery . The remote control would be fully flat and the buttons at the bottom would be flush with the LCD screen . The remote control would be made of rubber and the buttons at the bottom would be made of rubber . The remote control would be made of plastic with a rubber case and the buttons would be made of rubber .
Marketing introduced the first stage of the evaluation of the remote control , which was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of the company . The group agreed that the remote control should have a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . The design should minimise R-S-I and be easy to locate . The group also agreed that the remote control should be able to incorporate current fashion trends . The group then discussed the evaluation of the prototype . They agreed that the remote control should be easy to use and the design should be spongy .
Marketing thought that the spongy feel was no problem because the spongy feel would be in the rubber case , and the spongy feel would be in the rubber that would be put round the remote control . The base colour would be white or light blue with a light blue plastic , and the changeable faces would allow the user to get any one of a number of colours that could be customised .
Marketing did not think they had really touched on the minimization of repetitive strain injury a lot . They had n't really come up with anything that they felt could feasibly reduce that . The type of button that they were gon na use in the bottom half , the material , minimises RSI . The remote control was meant to be . It was quite obvious just big buttons .
The team decided to use a regular chip on print , a double-curved chip on print , one chip , one sample sensor and sample speaker , one chip , one chip , one single curve , one double curve , one single curve , one double curve , one chip , one sample sensor and one sample speaker . The cost of the remote control would be determined by the number of kinetic cells , the number of kinetic cells , the number of the number of kinetic cells , the number of the number of the chip , the number of the sensor and the number of the speaker . The team would use plastic and rubber as the casing material , with a special colour and a flat bottom with one curve .
User Interface suggested that the replacement of the kinetic batteries with a standard battery would make a huge difference in cost calculation and budget issues . User Interface thought that the biggest one would be taking away the biggest one if the battery was removed . User Interface also thought that the shape and colours of the battery should not be taken into consideration when designing the remote control .
The team decided to incorporate the voice recognition into the remote control because it would make it easier to locate and set it apart from the crowd . The voice recognition would be offered initially to business class customers . The team would then make the price fit and recommend the product to the head office .
The meeting was mainly about the overall discussion of the current work . The team discussed the structure of the influence structure and the design of the belief nodes . The team decided to start with the path nodes and then move on to the general influence stuff . The team also discussed the probabilities and the design of the belief nodes . The team also discussed the possibility of doing a binary Go-net and the cost of doing so .
The group discussed the future work and discussed the structure of the influence structure of what they think influences what . The professor suggested that they should start with the path ones and then move on to the general influence stuff . The professor also suggested that they should decide on the exact design of the influence structure before they decide how to compute it . The group also discussed the probability of the decision to go to the castle and the probability of going there in the first place .
The professor explained that the program was actually a program that would solve the problem of belief-net . The program would be a GUI to a simulator that would be able to generate a functioning belief-net at the other end . The professor also suggested that the user base should be non-local .
The professor thought that the team should be aware of the cost of the equipment , and that the cost of the equipment should be taken into consideration . The team also discussed the location of the recording equipment .
The group discussed the various properties that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . The professor suggested that they could change the mode of the endpoint to make it more user-friendly . The ontology could be used to help the user make decisions about the accessibility of the environment .
Grad B informed the team that the team was working on a way to make the data compact and compact enough to be used in multiple places . The team was also working on the design of a user state , which would be a set of decisions that the user could make about whether to enter a certain endpoint if it is not too tired or if it is too expensive .
The professor suggested that the team could save one of the old ones and open up the old one , which would make the old one clean and then the new one would be clean . The professor also suggested that they could keep the old one and reuse it .
The meeting was mainly about the design of the remote control . Project Manager introduced the three steps of the design of the remote control . The first step was the functional design , which included the functional design , the conceptual design , and the components and the specifications of the user interface . The second step was the conceptual design , which included the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . The third step was the design of the smartboard , which included the colour and the material . The team then discussed the design of the remote control and the price of the remote control .
The group discussed the conceptual design of the remote control , including the functions and some possible advanced techniques . Project Manager firstly explained that the group had to make a profit of fifty million Euros , and they had to use a big market in Europe . The production cost were about half the price of selling price , and the remote control should be made of a good quality . The group also discussed the design of the remote control , including the functions and some possible advanced techniques .
Project Manager thought that the remote control should be universal and only for television . He did not think that people could buy a universal remote control for twenty-five Euros .
Marketing thought that a touchscreen on the remote control would be too expensive and that it would be not reachable . User Interface thought that a touchscreen would be too expensive and that the manual could be made instead .
Industrial Design suggested to put the remote control in a recharger or a home station to recharge the batteries . Project Manager agreed with this idea , but User Interface suggested that the price of the recharger should be considered . Industrial Design suggested to sell the remote control separately and sell it separately .
Marketing had already set something on paper already , including the size , looks , usable , the buttons on usable places , the buttons on usable places , the on off button on top , the shape and the buttons on usable places . User Interface suggested that the basic things on the same place , like the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T-V channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume obviously on top , so the user could see . User Interface also suggested that the buttons that people use often were the basic options on top , like the basic options on top , the volume on top , and the buttons that were used often were the basic options .
User Interface suggested that the basic things could be put on the same place , like on off button on top and the channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume obviously on top , so that users could see . But the rest of the buttons should be clear as well , so if a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
The meeting was about the functional design of the remote control . Project Manager started the meeting with three presentations from the three participants . User Interface Designer presented the technical function design for user interface for the remote control . User Interface Designer proposed to design an elegant , easy to use inter interface with sophisticated functions and elegant design . Marketing Expert presented the new product requirements and the decision on the remote control functions . Project Manager then presented the new product requirements and the decision on the remote control functions .
User Interface presented the technical function design for user interface for the remote control . User Interface wanted to design elegant , easy to use inter interface . User Interface wanted to design a remote control with sophisticated functions while with easy to use user interface . Project Manager proposed to design a remote control which would be powerful and easy to use . Project Manager also proposed to have the remote control which would be powerful and easy to use .
User Interface proposed to design a remote control with sophisticated functions while with easy to use interface . Project Manager proposed to have the remote control with powerful functions and very easy to use . User Interface suggested to have international standards to make it easier to use .
The group discussed the connection of the Internet connection in the remote control design . The group agreed that the remote control should be able to connect to the internet and surf the web . The remote control should have a set box in the remote control to connect internet with the TV .
The group discussed the industrial design of the remote control . The group agreed that the remote control should be made out of leather and the infrared base should be made out of rubber . The remote control should be wireless because it was easier to manage and it would be cheaper than a battery . The group also agreed that the remote control should be made out of rubber and the infrared base should be made out of rubber .
The industrial designer thought that the technology would cost eight Euros and the remote control would be linked to the TV . The project manager thought that a cable between the remote control and the TV would not be a good idea . The remote control would be cheaper with the wire , but the wireless was more practical and easier to use .
User Interface Designer suggested that the remote control could mix several functions in one button , so that users could switch between different functions . However , Project Manager thought that it would be difficult for the user to know the difference between different functions if there were too many buttons . User Interface Designer suggested that the remote control could have a switch menu to switch between different functions .
Marketing informed the team that seventy-five percent of the users found the most remote controls ugly , and eighty percent of users would spend more money if the remote controls were not so ugly . User Interface was not so sure about how to make the remote control look fancy , because different people had a different opinion about fancy . Project Manager thought that having many functions in one button was not that good if the user wanted to zap a lot . Project Manager also thought that personalised colour would cost more .
User Interface suggested that a colourful remote control was fancy for some people , but simple and uniform colourful was fancy for other peoples . Industrial Designer thought that the solution was to have many colours of many colours instead of one grey standard . Project Manager thought that it would increase the price of the production of the remote control .
Project Manager thought that the price of the production of the remote control would increase if the colour of the remote control was personalised . Project Manager also thought that the price would increase if the colour of the remote control was changed . Project Manager also thought that the price would increase if the colour was changed .
The meeting was about the detailed design of the remote control . The team had discussed the prototype design and discussed the materials they would use and what kind of chip would be necessary . The team had a discussion about the prototype design and the cost of production . The team decided to use a combination of the regular and advanced batteries and the regular chip . The remote control would be made out of rubber and the base would be interchangeable with a variety of trendy fruit designs . The team also discussed the cost of production and decided that the cost of the chip would be more advanced than the iPod chip .
The remote control would have a wheel that could be used to change channels or volume , a power button , and a menu button . The base of the remote control would be interchangeable , and the colour could be changed to suit the living room . The remote control would be made of a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs , and people would be encouraged to buy three or five of them . The locator would be a chip that was inside the remote control , and the beeper would be inside there too . The remote control would be made of plastic with a double curve and a single curve .
The group discussed the problem of changing an aspect of the remote . Project Manager suggested that the worst one was three point one . Marketing thought that the material , the slide , and the shape were the worst . User Interface suggested that the remote could be made to be made to be more comfortable to hold . Industrial Designer thought the base would definitely be larger , and the wheel would probably be larger . User Interface suggested that the remote could be made to be made to look like fruit .
The team members thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product was fun and met all the criteria . They thought the leadership and teamwork was good and the team worked very well together . They thought the material used and the means for the materials used , how convenient were they , and the materials they used , like the pens , the whiteboard , were convenient . They also thought the team did n't really like PowerPoint and did n't really do really like doing presentations .
Marketing suggested changing the shape of the remote because the worst one was three point one . Project Manager thought the wheel would be bigger and the base would definitely be larger , but the group thought the base would be too big and awkward to hold . User Interface suggested that the remote could be made to look like broccoli and the wheel could be made to be made to look like a wheel .
Project Manager thought his leadership was crap personally . Industrial Designer thought it was good . They knew what they were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . Project Manager thought they all worked very well together . They did n't really have set roles so much , as they all had ideas about it .
The group thought that the materials were convenient to use , like the pens , the whiteboard , and the whiteboard . However , they did not find everything particularly helpful . For example , the group did not find PowerPoint particularly helpful . They thought that the information that was available to them was kind of just like what they had .
The meeting was about the progress of developing the new curriculum for Wales . Kirsty Williams AM introduced the main messages that the government had received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum . There was broad support for the curriculum changes that the government was proposing . There was also support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum , strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession , and the emphasis on formative assessment . In terms of some of the things that people were asking the government to look again at , some of the things that people were asking was around some of the language used .
The two main new areas that the government was now working on to include within the Bill were to ensure that there was breadth within the curriculum for everybody and to make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . The government would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas .
Kirsty Williams AM explained that the legislation would include the broad concepts of what matters , what they believe matters , in the area of learning and experience for well-being , and it would be put into the legislation . The 'what matters ' would be the broad concepts in health and well-being . It refers to both physical and mental health , and they intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters ' statements are a set given in the system .
Claire Bennett explained that the 'what matters ' were the articulation of the big ideas . These were the essence of the core content . The idea was to make sure that those were consistent , and then that still left huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those , which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them . The concept that you might not do one 'what matters ' was never what was intended . They were always intended to represent the learning that every learner should get . They wo n't be literally in the Bill , because , obviously , you might want to change the emphasis , so that 'll be provided for in subordinate legislation . The provision would be there , and they would have the status of something that 's not optional , basically , for a school .
Kirsty Williams AM said that the government was big supporters of the work of WISERD and the work that they did , and that they needed more research into Welsh education , not less . She also said that the curriculum in itself was neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity , in the sense that the curriculum was what was taught in the schools . There was an opportunity , she believed , that empowering teachers to be more flexible in what they taught their children actually gave them an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the schoolchildren than what they had at the moment . What would make the curriculum a success for all of the children , and would have a bigger impact on children who were in danger of being left behind , were the four enabling purposes of the curriculum .
The WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams would certainly buy into what the management teams would say , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . The reason was that the teachers would end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . And consistency was the one I 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there would be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum was delivered which could affect outcomes ' .
Kirsty Williams AM said that the curriculum was not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum , but it was always useful to reflect on how other systems had undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that had arisen . The curriculum had been able to learn from , and they had had people who had been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of the curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that they had had in terms of developing coherence .
Kirsty Williams AM explained that the money was the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . There was a national element to it , but the money was given to individual schools and individual headteachers because they had no way of knowing how each individual practitioner was ready or how much additional support they were going to need . The four regional consortia were working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . The next stages would be much more focused on individual AoLE and area-specific professional learning . There was a national approach in terms of leadership . The regional consortia were working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development was for subject specifics .
The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and Kirsty Williams AM continued to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning . Kirsty Williams AM was sure that the committee and members of this committee could help him in that task .
The meeting discussed the process of the innovation schools . The innovation schools were asked to apply to morph into the next phase , which was innovation schools . There were 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools , and 16â€”four per region . The schools were chosen because of their ability to do the final refinement of the curriculum , and they were chosen because of their ability to do that . They were also asked to produce a report setting out their reflections on the curriculum as a whole , and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on , 'If I were putting this into practice'
Kirsty Williams AM said that children 's rights , human rights had been key considerations throughout the design , and this was currently set out in overarching guidance . The team was continuing to work with the children 's commissioner 's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience . The output of that engagement and feedback had been drawn together into a report exploring learners â€™ views about schools and learning . It was a powerful contribution and would actually effect change , especially in how the 'what matters ' statements were worded .
Kirsty Williams AM said that they had a separate programme of work that was looking at resources that were needed to support the curriculum . It was one of the conversations she had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that they had had previously , where they had new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications were n't available . And this proposal by the Learned Society would be considered as part of that work .
Kirsty Williams AM said that it was really important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were really broad and not confined to specific areas . The continuum for language would have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child was being taught . There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language , and they had to be contextualised .
The meeting was mainly about the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the Mel scale . The team discussed the difference between the Aurora HTK baseline system and the other system , SRI . The Aurora system had a hundred hertz high-pass , while the SRI system had a twenty-hertz high-pass . The team also discussed the filter , which was set to zero at twenty hertz . The team also discussed the weighting of the spectrum .
The team discussed the number of deletions and insertions in the HM case . The number of deletions increased dramatically when the neural net was added . The number of insertions remained the same , but the number of deletions was a little bit lower . The noise subtraction was subtracting off speech . The noise subtraction was subtracting off speech . The team thought that the model was better without the neural net .
The professor thought that the neural net was not helping the model much until the second path was added . He thought that the neural net was doing similar things to the model as the model with the neural net without the side thing . The net was doing better on SpeechDat-Car , but it was still two percent relative worse on SpeechDat-Car .
The team discussed the noisy cases that they were seeing . The most noisy cases were the distant microphone for testing . The team thought that the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech . The TIMIT noises were a range of noises , not so much stationary driving kind of noises . The team thought that the neural net was not helping at all .
The team discussed the results of the VAD neural network and the latency of the VAD . The VAD was used for on-line normalization , and the latency was two hundred and twenty milliseconds . The VAD was also used for on-line normalization , and it was used before the delta computation . The VAD was also used for cleaning of the speech . The team thought that the latency was too large .
The professor was confused about the latency of VAD . He thought that the latency was two hundred and twenty milliseconds . The professor thought that the latency was after downsampling and after delta computation . The professor thought that the latency was two hundred and seventy milliseconds . The professor thought that the latency was because of the VAD 's normalization and the delta computation .
PhD C explained that the latency was caused by filtering of silence probabilities , which was a million filter that created a one hundred milliseconds delay . There was also a delta at the input , which was one hundred milliseconds for smoothing . The delta at the input was also one hundred milliseconds for smoothing .
The meeting was mainly about the progress of the group 's work on the project . The professor introduced the team to the new wireless headset , which was abandoned in favor of the lapel because it was far enough away from the microphone to get rid of background noise . The team discussed the cost of the project and the cost of the new machines . The professor also mentioned that the team was working on a new project to design a compute farm for the project . The team discussed the cost of the new machines and the cost of the new equipment . The professor also mentioned that the team was working on a project to design a new system for the task , which would be a speech recognition system .
The professor explained that the lapel was far enough away from the microphone to get more background noise , so it was not a good choice . The lapel was not so close that it got rid of all the interference . The lapel was also not so close that it got rid of all the interference . On the other hand , the lapel was a good choice because it was in the middle .
PhD F explained that the team had ordered twelve new machines to use as a compute farm . The team was running P- make and Customs , which had been fixed up and up to speed . The team was also working on the SRI recognizer , which had all the P- make customs stuff built into it . PhD F also explained that the team was working on parallelization .
The professor explained that the team was using the recognizer and was getting ready to start training . He also mentioned that the team was working on parallelization . The professor also mentioned that the team was working on the task of parallelization .
The team discussed spectral subtraction and spectral subtraction on the mel energies . The team was concerned about whether spectral subtraction was typically done on the mel energies after the scaling or on the FFT bins . The professor suggested that spectral subtraction was better done on the FFT bins . The team also discussed the effect of combining Wiener filtering with signal subspace . The professor thought that the Wiener filter was better than spectral subtraction .
The team had found some people who had implementation of VTS techniques . The team was interested in working with them . The team was also interested in getting rid of the noise and the channel effect .
The professor thought that the Wiener filter was not very effective if the SNR was very bad . He thought that it did not work well with poor SNR conditions and colored noise .
The meeting started with a detailed design meeting about the prototype of the remote control . User Interface presented the project presentation and gave a presentation on the product design . The prototype was made by clay with a shape of a triangle and a circle , with a yellow and red colour and a green colour . The product was made of clay and the basic colour was yellow and red , which was the company colour . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow shape and a green colour . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow shape and a green colour . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow colour and a green shape . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow colour and a green shape . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow colour and a green shape . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow colour and a green shape . The product was made of green and yellow with a yellow colour and a yellow shape . The
User Interface introduced the product appearance , including the colour yellow and red , the shape of a circle and a triangle , the shape of a mushroom , the fuzzy design , the circle channel selection , the triangle base , the shape of the buttons , the shape of the remote control , the buttons , the colour yellow and red , the shape of the buttons , the shape of the remote control , the shape of the base , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons , the buttons
User Interface thought the basic colour should be yellow and red because it was the company colour and the shape was a circle and a triangle . The shape was a mushroom design , so the team called it a mushroom design .
User Interface suggested that the prototype was fuzzy and unique with a circle channel selection , a stable triangle base and a cute button . Marketing disagreed with the user interface designer on the shape of the product because it was not in the trends and the marketing thought that the shape of the product was not like a mushroom because it was not in the trends .
Marketing suggested to measure the product 's features with a one to seven scale . The group agreed to give one point to seven for each feature . The product evaluation was based on the following criteria : fancy look and feel , colour , function , shape , buttons , function , function , microphone , etc .
Marketing thought the design was technologically innovative because it had a microphone array embedded , and the technology inside could recognise simple vocal comments . Users Interface and Project Manager agreed that the microphone could capture voice from different directions . The group also thought the design was easy to use because it had tactile buttons and the remote control was round .
Marketing thought that the remote control was easy to use for the vocal command , but the industrial designer thought it might be hard to jump from one to twenty . User Interface thought that the remote control was intuitive to change channels , but the marketing thought that it depended on the angle to change channels . Project Manager thought it was quite easy to turn , but maybe it would be too fast .
The group discussed the industrial design of the remote control and the cost of production . The industrial design included the battery battery , solar cell , voice recognition , and wooden plaques . The group agreed to have a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and a half Euros . The cost of the production cost was determined by the group 's evaluation of the prototype .
The group decided to keep the solar cells because it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell it . The group also decided that the remote control would be technologically innova innovative , so it would be technologically innova innovative , so it would be easy to use and powerful as it had only one button .
The industrial designer thought that it was good to follow the flow and make the product now and after , and if the people change their mind , then the product would change as well . The marketing thought that fruit and vegetables would not last for ten years , and insects would be dead in two years .
